# SOLID-SURFACE-ADSORPTION
# In this project, we focus on the chemisorption/physisorption on metal surfaces. 
# In progress:
# We try to find the optimzed ML modles to study the small molecules (with one or two atoms) chemisorption on metal surfaces. Within KNN model, we can reach accuarcy of 91% (we need to know the d_E values) but only for single atom adsorption. Now we try to train two-atom moelcular adsorptions.
